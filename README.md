# Commands to run simulation
- **Step 1**: Create a folder named "Slicing" 
- **Step 2**: Add all the files of code into the folder named Slicing created before.
- **Step 3**: Open Slicing folder in Vscode.
- **Step 4**: cd venv
- **Step 5**: cd Scripts
- **Step 6**: activate
- **Step 7**: cd ..
- **Step 8**: cd ..
- **Step 9**: pip install -r requirements.txt
- **Step 10**: pip freeze
- **Step 11**: python -m Slicing <input-file.yml>

# Future work
1. Video output of the running simulation.
2. Intrusion detection and prevention systems can be developed using  machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence.
3. We in our simulation had directly disabled the device, which can be  quarantined until it is declared safe.
4. Automatic allocation of network slicing can also be the future scope. 

# Work done
Implement 5G network slicing in IoT environment to secure the IoT  ecosystem from DDoS and DoS attacks by using IDS and IPS.

## Objectives
To implement 5G Network Slicing to increase scalability and flexibility  of network architecture.
To Integrate network slicing with IoT Applications
To design an algorithm to detect DDoS and DoS attacks in IoT  applications to secure IoT ecosystem.
